# CoupledDipoles.jl

*A Package In Development*

## **Installation**
This package uses `Bessel`, because is faster than `SpecialFunctions`, but it is an unregistred dependence. **MAYBE you had to install it manually before anything.**

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/JuliaMath/Bessels.jl")
```
